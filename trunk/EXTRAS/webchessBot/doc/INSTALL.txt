 Welcome to WebChess Bot.

 - We developed this engine to run under linux.
 - You can try to run it under windows. Should work too.



 Requeriments:
 
 - Under linux you need the CGI version of PHP.
 - At windows you should need the php.exe



 How it works:

 - There are one script located at bin directory. This script will run as a daemon and will verify if the computer needs to play. If so, it will call the engine and do the moves.



 Installation:

 1. First, you need to add the chess-bot players in the database. Actualy I have 3 players, but you can add more with different PLY (engine_flag):

 Open a mysql console:

 # mysql -u root -p 
 (type root password)

 mysql> use webchess; (or your database name)

 mysql> 
 INSERT INTO players (password, firstName,nick,engine,engine_flag) VALUES ('password!','Harpia', 'harpia', '1', '4');
 INSERT INTO players (password, firstName,nick,engine,engine_flag) VALUES ('password!','Cerberus', 'cerberus', '1', '5');
 INSERT INTO players (password, firstName,nick,engine,engine_flag) VALUES ('password!','Medusa', 'medusa', '1', '7');


 2. Second: you need to edit bin/play.php and make sure that this file has +x permission.
    You neet to change the path of PHP: At the header of this file you will see:
	#!/usr/bin/php4 -q (Change to the correct path of your php cgi)
    At windows it wont work. You need to call "php.exe play.php"
    You need to change the $bot_path, $webchess_path and $engine_name.
    These paths are the engine path and the webchess php files path.
		
 3. Edit the paths in chessdaemon.sh and make sure that this file has +x permission

 4. At linux you can run the engine jut typing: chessdaemon.sh&
    At windows only execute: /path_to_php/php.exe /path_to_engine/bin/play.php

 Hint:
 - You can also put the webchess bot player in other computer. You only need to place another copy of webchess in the new computer and modify the mysql server ip.
 - If anything goes wrong, you can see the logs in the path you specified in chessdaemon.sh

 
 WARNING:

 - Bots with high PLY (6 or more) can Use a lot of CPU time ! If you are planing to have a lot of users. You should need a dedicated server.
