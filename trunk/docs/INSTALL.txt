 This is Comp WebChess. You can found newer versions at:
 http://www.compwebchess.com

 
Requirements:

 - PHP >= 4.x
 - PHP Extensions: PHP_GD (for graph statistics)
 - JPGraph (included)
 - MySQL >= 3.x



Installation:

 1. Uncompress compWebchess in a web-accessible directory (ex: /var/www/chess)

 2. Create a MySQL user (similar to the sample user_permissions.txt)

 3. Create a MySQL Database:
    mysql> create database webchess;

 3. Import the database structure (see file mylsq-script.txt)

 4. Update the database settings and other desired info in config.php

 5. Under linux, you need to make the avatar directory writeable by the server:
    # chmod 777 /webchess_path/images/avatars

 6. If you enable logging support, don´t forget to make webchess.log writeable
    for your www server: 
  
    # touch /var/log/webchess.log
    # chown www-data /var/log/webchess.log

 7. Done!

Note: CompWebChess was only tested in linux servers but should work with Win
Servers too.
