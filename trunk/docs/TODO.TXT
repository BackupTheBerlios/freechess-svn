TODO LIST
2005-03-03 trukfixer
Search mainmenu.php and all new or changed files for any //TODO comment and sort them into this file.
I didnt take the time, since there have been so many massive changes to the files as a whole.

mainmenu.php is now fully adodb equipped, and database errorrs are now logged. a completely new swl schema is in the works, teams has been removed
Forums have been removed, thematics removed, these need to have separate woirk done to make them modular
Next step- getting all the new data into the template and change the template layout plus fix teh template buttons
remove all non-game critical javascript (the stupid onsubmit functions, namely . this code has *FAR* too much javascript in it )

Start working on chess.php and get a game playable for further testing, then we'll worry about the remaining features.
 Start getting output into output buffering functions
2005-01-25 trukfixer
**DONE**-- PLACE header license on ALL files where possible (not required in templates)
**DONE** -- REMOVE ob.lib.php  Numerous warnings and errors- We can handle output buffering with FAR less code
          using Smarty templates and php's own ob_start(), etc functions. Also we can enable elvels of compression
**DONE** -- BEGIN integrating adodb encrypted sessions library and create database table
**DONE** -- BEGIN restructure and re-naming database tables fields and do a review on what is needed, what will allow us to optimize queries
         and reduce processing time
-- WRITE benchmark functions for memory usage, processing time, etc.
-- Get all pages templated, eliminate all echos or other output from any and all PHP files.
-- Javascript bugs- these may need a TODO, and changelog all their own.

Archived List- Remove as needed.

1.) When a user first logs in they seem to be at a lose.  They do not
know how to get a game started.  It might be a good idea to have some
place where current users can create open challenges.  That way when a
new user logs in they could go to the a page where there are open
challenges waiting for them to join.   The user could configure what
rating would be allowed to accept the challenges.  I think it is
important that users not be able to create a challenge unless they have
finished at least five game.  It would be a good feature if when someone
challenges you a pop up window would appear, no matter what page you
were on,  saying you have been challenged to a game.  Then you could
accept or reject the challenge.  If you reject maybe the users specify
why they can't accept the challenge.  Or maybe it could have a drop down
feature that would allow the user to choose why they do not want to
accept the challenge at this time.

2.) I get a lot of requests for messaging system.  Users want to be able
to send messages to people even if they are not in a game with them.

3.) Users have asked for a feature when signing up that would allow the
to choose their rating estimated rating. I had one user that was a
strong player complain about having to play weaker players before they
could challenge the higher rated players.

4.) Some users have suggested that the rating system be changed to the
ELO rating system <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system>.

5.) The chat modification that Georg added seems to be hard on the
server.  I had to upgrade my server because of this.  It might be better
to integrate java irc chat or phpchat into the program some how.
Georg's iframe chat seems to use to much bandwidth.

6) Some sort of next button that would allow players to move from one
game to the next would be a nice feature.  For an example of this go to
http://www.chesscorner.net  it is user there.  In chess.php if you have
active games where it is your move a NEXT button appears and you can
move from game to game where it is your move.
